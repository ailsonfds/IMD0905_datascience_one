Because we can easily work across multiple dimensions, our code is a lot easier to understand. By using vectorized operations instead of loops, our code will be faster with larger data.\n","\n","NumPy provides fundamental structures and tools that makes working with data easier, but there are several things that limit it usefulness as a single tool when working with data:\n","\n","- The lack of support for column names forces us to frame the questions we want to answer as multi-dimensional array operations.\n","- Support for only one data type per ndarray makes it more difficult to work with data that contains both numeric and string data.\n","- There are lots of low level methods, however there are many common analysis patterns that don't have pre-built methods.\n","\n","The **pandas** library provides solutions to all of these pain points and more. Pandas is not so much a replacement for NumPy as an extension of NumPy. The underlying code for pandas uses the NumPy library extensively, which means the concepts you've been learning will come in handy as you begin to learn more about pandas.\n","\n","In this mission, we'll learn:\n","\n","- about the two core pandas types: dataframes and series\n","- how to select data using row and column labels\n","- a variety of methods for exploring data with pandas\n","- how to assign data using various techniques in pandas\n","- how to use boolean indexing with pandas for selection and assignment\n","\n","We'll be working with data set from [Fortune](http://fortune.com/) magazine's [Global 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_Global_500) list 2017, which ranks the top 500 corporations worldwide by revenue.

Pandas uses NumPy dtypes for numeric columns, including **integer64**. There is also a type we haven't seen before, **object**, which is used for columns that have data that doesn't fit into any other dtypes. This is almost always used for columns containing string values. If you like, you can run **f500.dtypes** in the console to see the types of all the columns in the f500 dataframe.\n","\n","When we import data, pandas will attempt to guess the correct dtype for each column. Generally, pandas does a pretty good job with this, which means we don't need to worry about specifying dtypes every time we start to work with data. Later in this course, we'll look at how to change the dtype of a column.\n","\n","Next, let's learn a few handy methods we can use to get some high-level information about our dataframe:\n","\n","- If we wanted to view the first few rows of our dataframe, we can use the [DataFrame.head()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.head.html) method, which returns the first 5 rows of our dataframe. The **DataFrame.head()** method also accepts an optional integer parameter which specified the number of rows. We could use **f500.head(10)** to return the first 10 rows of our **f500 dataframe**-.\n","- Similar in function to **DataFrame.head()**, we can use the [DataFrame.tail()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html) method, to shows us the last rows of our dataframe. The **DataFrame.tail()** method accepts an optional integer parameter to specify the number of rows, defaulting to 5.\n","- If we wanted to get an overview of all the dtypes used in our dataframe, along with its shape and some extra information, we could use the [DataFrame.info()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.info.html#pandas.DataFrame.info) method. Note that **DataFrame.info()** prints the information, rather than returning it, so we can't assign it to a variable.\n","\n","Let's practice using these three new methods. Just like in the previous missions, the f500 variable we created in the previous section is available to you here.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","1. Using the links above to the documentation if you need to, use the three methods we just learned about to learn more about the **f500** dataframe:\n","\n","  - Use the **head()** method to select the first 6 rows and assign the result to **f500_head**.\n","  - Use the **tail()** method to select the last 8 rows and assign the result to **f500_tail.**\n","  - Use the **info()** method to display information about the dataframe.\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"JW4ZDCUFs0X8","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":343},"outputId":"03554323-2af6-47f3-a45d-ffa00e6f4f86","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1535995471447,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":560,"user":{"displayName":"AILSON FORTE","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s128","userId":"100255589969657971121"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# put your code here\n","f500_head = f500.head()\n","f500_head"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>rank</th>\n","      <th>revenues</th>\n","      <th>revenue_change</th>\n","      <th>profits</th>\n","      <th>assets</th>\n","      <th>profit_change</th>\n","      <th>ceo</th>\n","      <th>industry</th>\n","      <th>sector</th>\n","      <th>previous_rank</th>\n","      <th>country</th>\n","      <th>hq_location</th>\n","      <th>website</th>\n","      <th>years_on_global_500_list</th>\n","      <th>employees</th>\n","      <th>total_stockholder_equity</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Walmart</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>485873</td>\n","      <td>0.8</td>\n","      <td>13643.0</td>\n","      <td>198825</td>\n","      <td>-7.2</td>\n","      <td>C.

In pandas, null values are represented using NaN, just like in NumPy.\n","\n","Because our axes in pandas have labels, we can select data using those labels, unlike in NumPy where we needed to know the exact index location. To do this, we use the [DataFrame.loc[]](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html#pandas.DataFrame.loc) method.\n","\n","Throughout our pandas missions you'll see **df** used in code examples as shorthand for a dataframe object. We use this convention because you also see this throughout the official pandas documentation, so getting used to reading it is important. You'll notice that we use brackets **([])** instead of parentheses **(())** when selecting by location. This is similar to how we use brackets when selecting by location in Python lists or NumPy arrays. The syntax for the **DataFrame.loc[]** method is:\n","\n","```python\n","df.loc[row, column]\n","```\n","\n","Where **row** and **column** refer to row and column labels respectively, and can be one of:\n","\n","- A single label.\n","- A list or array of labels.\n","- A slice object with labels.\n","- A boolean array.\n","\n","We'll look at boolean arrays later in this mission - for now, we're going to focus on the first three options. We're going to use the same selection of data we used in the previous screen, which is stored using the variable name **f500_selection** to make these examples easier.\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WNexstd5iVGtj04VxjcnQSqa-UTSETDg\">\n","\n","\n","In each of these examples, we're going to use **:** to specify that we wish to select all rows, so we can focus making selections using column labels only.\n","\n","First, let's select a single column by specifying a single label:\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15V82UWlysJjrA_Eg0b5vKPeMcagBhQCI\">\n","\n","\n","Selecting a single column returns a pandas series. We'll talk about pandas series objects more in the next screen, but for now the important thing is to note that the new series has the same index axis labels as the original dataframe.

This is an important distinction – when we uses slices with lists and in NumPy, it does not include the end slice. The reason that this is different with **loc[]** is that with labels is less obvious what the end slice would be. When we're using integers, we know that the number after **3** is **4**, but knowing the column label that comes after profits is not as obvious.\n","\n","Let's practice using these techniques to select specific columns from our f500 dataframe.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","1.

Pandas also has a large number of methods and functions that make working with data easier. Let's use a few of these to explore our Fortune 500 data.\n","\n","The first method we'll learn about is the [Series.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.describe.html#pandas.Series.describe) method, which returns some descriptive statistics on the data contained within a specific pandas series. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","```python\n","revs = f500[\"revenues\"]\n","print(revs.describe())\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","count       500.000000\n","mean      55416.358000\n","std       45725.478963\n","min       21609.000000\n","25%       29003.000000\n","50%       40236.000000\n","75%       63926.750000\n","max      485873.000000\n","Name: revenues, dtype: float64\n","```\n","\n","We've assigned the **revenues** column to a new series, **revs**, and then used the **describe()** method on that series. The method tells us how many non-null values are contained in the series, the mean and standard devation, along with the minimum, maximum and [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) values.\n","\n","Rather than assigning the series to it's own variable, we can actually skip that step and use the method directly on the result of the column selection. This is called **method chaining** and is a way to combine multiple methods together in a single line. It's not unique to pandas, however it is something that you see a lot in pandas code. Let's see what the command looks like with method chaining, using the **assets** column.\n","\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500[\"assets\"].describe())\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","count    5.000000e+02\n","mean     2.436323e+05\n","std      4.851937e+05\n","min      3.717000e+03\n","25%      3.658850e+04\n","50%      7.326150e+04\n","75%      1.805640e+05\n","max      3.473238e+06\n","Name: assets, dtype: float64\n","```\n","\n","From here, you'll start to see method chaining used more in our missions. When writing code, you should always assess whether method chaining will make your code harder to read. It's always preferable to break out into more than one line if it will make your code easier to understand.\n","\n","You might have noticed that the values in the code segment above look a little bit different. Because the values for this column are too long to display neatly, pandas has displayed them in **E-notation**, a type of [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation). Here is an expansion of what the E-notation represents:\n","\n","| Original Notation | Expanded Formula | Result |\n","|-------------------|--------------------|----------|\n","| 5.000000E+02 | 5.000000 * 10 ** 2 | 500 |\n","| 2.436323E+05 | 2.436323 * 10 ** 5 | 243632.3 |\n","\n","\n","If we use **describe()** on a column that contains non-numeric values, we get some different statistics. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500[\"country\"].describe())\n","\n","count     500\n","unique     34\n","top       USA\n","freq      132\n","Name: country, dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","Here is what the output indicates:\n","\n","The first statistic, **count**, is the same as for numeric columns, showing us the number of non-null values. The other three statistics are new:\n","\n","- **unique** - The number of unique values in the series. In this case, it tells us that there are 34 different countries represented in the Fortune 500.\n","- **top** - The most common value in the series. The USA is the most common country that a company in the Fortune 500 is headquartered in.\n","- **freq** - The frequency of the most common value. The USA is the country that 132 companies from Fortune 500 are headquartered in.\n","\n","Because series' and dataframes are two distinct objects, they have their own unique methods. There are many times where both series and dataframe objects have a method of the same name that behaves in similar ways. DataFrame objects also have a [DataFrame.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) method that returns these same statistics for every column. If you like, you can take a look at the documentation using the link in the previous sentence to familiarize yourself with some of the differences between the two methods.\n","\n","One difference is that you need to specify manually if you want to see the statistics for the non-numeric columns. By default, **DataFrame.describe()** will return statistics for only numeric columns. If we wanted to get just the object columns, we need to use the **include=['O']** parameter when using the dataframe version of describe:\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500.describe(include=['O']))\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","_            ceo    industry     sector  country  hq_location    website\n","count        500         500        500      500          500        500\n","unique       500          58         21       34          235        500\n","top     Xavie...   Banks:...  Financ...      USA  Beijing,...  http:/...\n","freq           1          51        118      132           56          1\n","```\n","\n","Another difference is that **Series.describe()** returns a series object, where **DataFrame.describe()** returns a dataframe object. \n","\n","Let's practice using both the series and dataframe describe methods:\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","1. Use the appropriate **describe()** method to:\n","  - Return a series of descriptive statistics for the **profits** column, and assign the result to **profits_desc**.\n","  - Return a dataframe of descriptive statistics for the **revenues** and **employees** columns, in order, and assign the result to **revenue_and_employees_desc**.\n","  - Return a dataframe of descriptive statistics for every column in the **f500** dataframe, by checking the documentation for the correct value for the **include** parameter, and assign the result to **all_desc**.\n","\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"h43tBXdoKpnl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":179},"outputId":"59f04d61-003d-4ced-fe4c-fc3efdbc1bbe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1535995487763,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":601,"user":{"displayName":"AILSON

is designed to operate like NumPy, a lot of concepts and methods from Numpy are supported. One basic concept is vectorized operations.

Here are a few handy methods (with links to documentation) that you might use when working with data in pandas:\n","\n","- [Series.max()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.max.html) and [DataFrame.max()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.max.html)\n","- [Series.min()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.min.html) and [DataFrame.min()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.min.html)\n","- [Series.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.mean.html) and [DataFrame.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html)\n","- [Series.median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.median.html) and [DataFrame.median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.median.html)\n","- [Series.mode()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.mode.html) and [DataFrame.mode()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mode.html)\n","- [Series.sum()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.sum.html) and [DataFrame.sum()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sum.html)\n","\n","\n","As the documentation indicates, the series methods don't require an axis parameter, however the dataframe methods will so we know which axis to calculate across.

In pandas this works almost identically, however the resulting boolean object will be either a series or a dataframe, depending on the object on which the boolean comparison was performed. Let's look an example of performing a boolean comparison on a series vs a dataframe:\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1BJNbnwxzO7TBjbYhFJppw1o93Tnn7xMU\">\n","\n","\n","It's much less common to use a boolean dataframe than a boolean series in pandas. You almost always want to use the results of a comparison on one column from dataframe (a series object) to select data in the main dataframe, or a selection of the main dataframe.\n","\n","Let's look at two examples of how that works in diagram form. For our example, we'll be working with this dataframe of people and their favorite numbers:\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FqhK-Kfr7u7JDeAbfEFxn3_0nONlIpp1\">\n","\n","Let's check which people have a favorite number of 8. We perform a vectorized boolean operation that produces a boolean series:\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1OgQSNM8KwzI5Mr3UJ4Y-89tXdc9t6Ybg\">\n","\n","\n","We can use that series to index the whole dataframe, leaving us the rows that correspond only to people whose favorite number is 8.\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WeDutjUzaV2RqdHgJkSVWQNPOguqskak\">\n","\n","Note that we didn't used **loc[]**. This is because boolean arrays use the same shortcut as slices to select along the index axis. \n","\n","\n","Now let's look at an example of using boolean indexing with our Fortune 500 dataset. We want find out which are the 5 most common countries for companies belonging to the **'Motor Vehicles and Parts'** industry.\n","\n","We start by making a boolean series that shows us which rows from our dataframe have the value of **Motor Vehicles and Parts** for the **industry** column. We'll then print the first five items of our boolean series so we can see it in action:\n","\n","\n","```python\n",">>> motor_bool = f500[\"industry\"] == \"Motor Vehicles and Parts\"\n","\n",">>> print(motor_bool.head())\n","\n","    Walmart                     False\n","    State Grid                  False\n","    Sinopec Group               False\n","    China National Petroleum    False\n","    Toyota Motor                 True\n","    Name: industry, dtype: bool\n","```\n","\n","\n","Notice that like our examples in the diagrams above, the index labels are retained in our boolean series. Next, we use that boolean series to select only the rows that have **True** for our boolean index, and just the **country** column, and then print the first 5 items to check the values:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> motor_countries = f500.loc[motor_bool, \"country\"]\n","\n",">>> print(motor_countries.head())\n","\n","    Toyota Motor        Japan\n","    Volkswagen        Germany\n","    Daimler           Germany\n","    General Motors        USA\n","    Ford Motor            USA\n","    Name: country, dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","\n","Lastly, we can use the **value_counts()** method for the **motor_countries** series, chained to the **head()** method to produce a series of the top 5 countries for the 'Motor Vehicles and Parts' industry:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> top5_motor_countries = motor_countries.value_counts().head()\n","\n",">>> print(top5_motor_countries)\n","\n","    Japan          10\n","    China           7\n","    Germany         6\n","    France          3\n","    South Korea     3\n","    Name: country, dtype: int64\n","```\n","\n","Let's practice using boolean indexing in pandas to identify the five highest ranked companies from South Korea.
