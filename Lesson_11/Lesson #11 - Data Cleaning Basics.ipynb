lowest levels, can only understand binary - 0 and 1. Encodings are systems for representing characters in binary. From the early days of computers, the standard for representing text was called ASCII. The ASCII standard specified a set of 128 standard characters - these were letters, numbers and punctuation marks that were used for the English language. For instance, the letter **a** in ASCII is represented as **01100001** in binary.\n","\n","ASCII was very useful for the basic letters and numbers in the english language, but as the popularity of computers spread worldwide, different computer manufacturers created new encodings to encode different characters, like the greek character $\\alpha$ or the Japanse character も. Because there wasn't one standard for encodings there were problems when you tried to read files saved using one character set with a computer that used a different character set.\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NzDcepAjvJESItrSbykVB3L9SFdLCLaS\">\n","\n","As a result, there ended up being dozens of different encodings being used throughout the early days of the web. Ideally, the person sending you a file would tell you what encoding it is in, however in reality that rarely happened (and still doesn't). Trying to work out what encoding a file was in was relatively difficult, and you often had to guess.\n","\n","These days, we often still have to guess, however in the last 15 years the number of encodings being commonly used has decreased. This means that the vast majority of files are encoded in one of 2-3 formats.\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mPe_Flzn-VfBCZht69_k2rpopYpHqHYY\">\n","\n","\n","The diagram above shows the usage of different encodings on the web. As you can see, **UTF-8** has grown rapidly to be the predominant encoding being used. Because of this trend, the best thing to do if your file has an unknown encoding is to try the most common encodings. The most common encodings are, in order:\n","\n","- UTF-8 (the default for Python)\n","- Latin-1 (also known as ISO-8895-1)\n","- Windows-1251\n","\n","To specify a encoding when reading a CSV file with pandas, simply use the **encoding** argument within the **pandas.read_csv()** function, specifying the encoding as a string:\n","\n","```python\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"filename.csv\", encoding=\"UTF-8\")\n","```\n","\n","\n","Because **UTF-8** is the default, you don't need to specify it the file you're reading is encoded with **UTF-8** (you'll notice the error message mentions **UTF-8**)\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","- Use the **pandas.read_csv()** function to read the **laptops.csv** file into a dataframe laptops.\n","  - Specify the encoding using the string **\"Latin-1\"**.\n","  - If that doesn't work, try using the string **\"Windows-1251\"**.\n","- Use the **DataFrame.info()** method to display information about the laptops dataframe."]},{"metadata":{"id":"_BXD78k3iv7H","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":341},"outputId":"698b07a0-fc34-46fb-e68b-6c3d930d3463","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1537203557196,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":1283,"user":{"displayName":"AILSON FORTE","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s128","userId":"100255589969657971121"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# put your code here\n","laptops = pd.read_csv(\"laptops.csv\", encoding=\"Latin-1\")\n","laptops.info()"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 1303 entries, 0 to 1302\n","Data columns (total 13 columns):\n","Manufacturer                1303 non-null object\n","Model Name                  1303 non-null object\n","Category                    1303 non-null object\n","Screen Size                 1303 non-null object\n","Screen                      1303 non-null object\n","CPU                         1303 non-null object\n","RAM                         1303 non-null object\n"," Storage                    1303 non-null object\n","GPU                         1303 non-null object\n","Operating System            1303 non-null object\n","Operating System Version    1133 non-null object\n","Weight                      1303 non-null object\n","Price (Euros)               1303 non-null object\n","dtypes: object(13)\n","memory usage: 132.4+ KB\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"fkXLBIP2j-gb","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2.0 Cleaning Column Names\n","\n","This is the output of the **DataFrame.info()** method from the previous screen:\n","\n","```python\n","class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'\n","RangeIndex: 1303 entries, 0 to 1302\n","Data columns (total 13 columns):\n","Manufacturer                1303 non-null object\n","Model Name                  1303 non-null object\n","Category                    1303 non-null object\n","Screen Size                 1303 non-null object\n","Screen                      1303 non-null object\n","CPU                         1303 non-null object\n","RAM                         1303 non-null object\n"," Storage                    1303 non-null object\n","GPU                         1303 non-null object\n","Operating System            1303 non-null object\n","Operating System Version    1133 non-null object\n","Weight                      1303 non-null object\n","Price (Euros)               1303 non-null object\n","dtypes: object(13)\n","memory usage: 132.4+ KB\n","```\n","\n","The column labels have a variety of upper and lowercase letters, as well as spaces and parentheses.
