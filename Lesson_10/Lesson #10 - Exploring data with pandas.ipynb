To select data by integer position using pandas we use the [Dataframe.iloc[]](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html) method and the [Series.iloc[]](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.iloc.html) method.

The full syntax for **DataFrame.iloc[]**, in psuedocode, is:\n","\n","```python\n","df.iloc[row,column]\n","```\n","\n","The valid inputs for row and column are almost identical to when you use **DataFrame.loc[]**, with the distinction being that you are using integers rather than labels:\n","\n","- A single integer position.\n","- A list or array of integer positions.\n","- A slice object with integer positions.\n","- A boolean array.\n","\n","Let's say we wanted to select just the first column from our **f500** dataframe. To do this, we use the : wildcards to specify all rows, and then use the integer 0 to specify the first column:\n","\n","```python\n","first_column = f500.iloc[:,0]\n","print(first_column)\n","```\n","```python\n","0                        Walmart\n","1                     State Grid\n","2                  Sinopec Group\n","...\n","497    Wm.

In this mission, we're going to teach you how to use the [pandas.read_csv()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) function to read in CSV files. Before we start, let's take a look at the first few lines of our CSV file in its raw form.

The **index_col** parameter specifies which column to use as the row labels. We use a value of **0** to specify that we want to use the first column.\n","\n","Let's look at what the **f500** dataframe looks like after that first line. We'll use **DataFrame.iloc[]** to show the first 5 rows and the first 3 columns:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> f500 = pd.read_csv(\"f500.csv\", index_col=0)\n","\n",">>> print(f500.iloc[:5, :3])\n","\n","                              rank  revenues  revenue_change\n","    company                                                    \n","    Walmart                      1    485873             0.8\n","    State Grid                   2    315199            -4.4\n","    Sinopec Group                3    267518            -9.1\n","    China National Petroleum     4    262573           -12.3\n","    Toyota Motor                 5    254694             7.7\n","```\n","\n","Notice that above the index labels is the text **company**.

As a result, this means, that while our dataframe has all of the rows, in the same order, as when we read it in, that the integer position and the label for the index axis is the same. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1VeQE7W6ylvfg524QrO2tJ_-iFRud_04F\">\n","\n","\n","Because the index axis of our dataframe has labels that are identical to the integer positions, both **loc[]** and **iloc[]** give the same result. But what if we have modified our dataframe in some way. Let's reorder the rows of our dataframe, and then see what happens:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KT2Dus_gxSDfPeBSSxqNkoU8NWXJFlVk\">\n","\n","Now we get different results. When we use **df.iloc[1]** it still selects the second row, since **DataFrame.iloc[]** uses integer position. However, **df.loc[1]** selects the **third row– DataFrame.loc[]** itself doesn't mind that the rows are out of order, it just looks at the axis labels and selects the row with the matching label.\n","\n","This is one of the most confusing parts of selecting data with pandas. You might not come across it often, because a lot of the time you'll work with a dataframe where the index labels are integers, and the dataframe contains all of its original rows, in order. You can use **DataFrame.iloc[]** and **DataFrame.loc[]** interchangeably and it doesn't matter which you chose.\n","\n","Then, you remove some rows or change the order, and suddenly you're getting errors or unexpected behavior. For this reason, it's important to make sure that when you're selecting data you're always asking yourself, \"Do I want to select based on position or label?\" and choosing **DataFrame.iloc** or **DataFrame.loc[]** accordingly. Let's look at some examples with our **f500** dataframe where we come across this 'gotcha' to do with integer labels.\n","\n","Let's say that we wanted to select just the Swedish companies from the Fortune 500:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> swedish = f500.loc[f500[\"country\"] == \"Sweden\",\"company\":\"revenues\"]\n","\n",">>> print(swedish)\n","\n","                        company  rank  revenues\n","    300                   Volvo   301     35269\n","    418             LM Ericsson   419     26004\n","    481  H & M Hennes & Mauritz   482     22618\n","```\n","\n","If we wanted to select the first company from our new swedish dataframe, we can use **DataFrame.iloc[]**:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> first_swedish = swedish.iloc[0]\n","\n",">>> print(first_swedish)\n","\n","    company     Volvo\n","    rank          301\n","    revenues    35269\n","    Name: 300, dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","Let's see what happens when we use **DataFrame.loc[]** instead of **DataFrame.iloc[]**:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> first_swedish = swedish.loc[0]\n","\n","    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","    KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\n","    /python3.4/site-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py in _has_valid_type(self, key, axis)\n","       1410                 if key not in ax:\n","    -> 1411                     error()\n","       1412             except TypeError as e:\n","\n","    /python3.4/site-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py in error()\n","       1405                 raise KeyError(\"the label [%s] is not in the [%s]\" %\n","    -> 1406                                (key, self.obj._get_axis_name(axis)))\n","       1407 \n","\n","    KeyError: 'the label [0] is not in the [index]'\n","```\n","\n","We get an error, telling us that **the label [0] is not in the [index]** (the actual traceback for this error is much longer than this, we have truncated it for brevity).

There are also a number of pandas methods that return boolean masks that are useful for working with an exploring data.\n","\n","You might have noticed that for companies from the USA, the **hq_location** column contains both the city and state that the company is headquartered in:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> usa_hqs = f500.loc[f500[\"country\"] == \"USA\", \"hq_location\"]\n","\n",">>> print(usa_hqs.head())\n","\n","    0       Bentonville, AR\n","    7             Omaha, NE\n","    8         Cupertino, CA\n","    9            Irving, TX\n","    10    San Francisco, CA\n","    Name: hq_location, dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","The two letters at the end of each of these values represent the state within the USA: AR for Arkansas, NE for Nebreska, CA for California, and TX for Texas. If we wanted to look at only companies headquartered in California, it would be useful to be able to create a boolean mask based on the text within these values.\n","\n","There are two pandas methods that we could use to achieve this: the [Series.str.contains()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.contains.html) method and the [Series.str.endswith()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.endswith.html) method.

As an example, to answer the first question we would have to identify all the companies that have over 100 billion in revenue and also have revenue growth of more than 10%. To do this, we need to learn how to combine boolean arrays.\n","\n","To recap, boolean arrays are created using any of the Python standard **comparison operators**: **==** (equal), **>** (greater than), **<** (less than), **!=** (not equal).\n","\n","We combine boolean arrays using **boolean operators**.

Just like when we use a single boolean array to perform selection, when using multiple boolean arrays with boolean operators we don't need to assign things to intermediate variables. Let's look at how we can streamline the code from the example above. First, let's look at the code as one segment:\n","\n","```python\n","cols = [\"company\", \"revenues\", \"country\"]\n","final_cols = [\"company\", \"revenues\"]\n","\n","f500_sel = f500[cols].head()\n","over_265 = f500_sel[\"revenues\"] > 265000\n","china = f500_sel[\"country\"] == \"China\"\n","combined = over_265 & china\n","result = f500_sel.loc[combined,final_cols]\n","```\n","\n","The first place we can optimize our code is by making our two boolean comparisons, with their boolean operator in a single line, instead of assigning them to the intermediate **china** and **over_265** variables first:\n","\n","\n","```python\n","combined = (f500_sel[\"revenues\"] > 265000) & (f500_sel[\"country\"] == \"China\")\n","```\n","\n","We have used parentheses around each of our boolean comparisons. This is very important– **our boolean operation will fail without parentheses**. Lastly, instead of assigning the boolean arrays to **combined**, we can insert the comparison directly into our selection:\n","\n","```python\n","result = f500_sel.loc[(f500_sel[\"revenues\"] > 265000) & (f500_sel[\"country\"] == \"China\"), final_cols]\n","```\n","\n","Whether to perform this final state is very much a matter of taste. As always, your decision should be driven by what will make your code more readable.

One of the most powerful aspects of pandas is that almost every operation will **align on the index labels**. Let's look at an example– below we have a dataframe **food** and a **series** colors:\n","\n","<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_LAUprnXe3BYUgUg2r5fS2kfPpoTtdgt\">\n","\n","Both the **food** dataframe and the **colors** series have the same index labels, however they are in totally different orders. As an example, the first row of **food** has the index label **tomato**, and the first item of **colors** has the index label **corn**.\n","\n","If we wanted to add **colors** as a new column in our **food** dataframe, we can use the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","food[\"color\"] = colors\n","```\n","\n","When we do this, pandas will ignore the order of the colors series, and align on the index labels:\n","\n","<img width=\"350\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zD-HqxfZ8yUj_4pNrbQasrnASTX0zhQE\">\n","\n","The result of our code operation is the dataframe below:\n","\n","<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1hDfSi-D5sJf788MlGOI63vmAlLYrVIYU\">\n","\n","\n","We can see that pandas has done all the hard work for us, and we don't have to worry about the fact that our series and dataframe were ordered differently. Let's look at another example.

Because one of the key benefits of pandas is that it has vectorized methods to work with data more efficiently, we want to avoid using loops wherever we can.\n","\n","As an illustration, let's look at one common pattern that you might be tempted to use a loop for, and how we can use a vectorized operation to replace it. Let's try and replace all of the values in the column **B** a dataframe:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(df)\n","\n","       A  B  C\n","    x  6  1  0\n","    y  1  8  8\n","    z  3  8  7\n","\n",">>> for row in df:\n","        if row[\"B\"] == 8:\n","            row[\"B\"] = 99\n","\n","    ---------------------------------------------------\n","    TypeError                                 Traceback\n","    <ipython-input-17-baf1fd443d29> in module()\n","          1 for row in df:\n","    ----> 2     if row[\"B\"] == 8:\n","          3         row[\"B\"] = 99\n","\n","    TypeError: string indices must be integers\n","</ipython-input-17-baf1fd443d29>\n","```\n","\n","In this code, we attempted to loop over every row of the dataframe, check the value for a particular column, and if it matches our check, we change it. Unfortunately, our code produced an error.\n","\n","When you attempt to loop over a dataframe, it returns the column index labels, rather than the rows as we might expect. There are pandas methods to help loop over dataframes, but they should be only used as a last resort, and can almost always be avoided (we'll learn about those methods in a later course).\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(df)\n","\n","       A  B  C\n","    x  6  1  0\n","    y  1  8  8\n","    z  3  8  7\n","\n",">>> for i in df:\n","        print(i)\n","\n","    A\n","    B\n","    C\n","```\n","\n","Instead of trying to use loops, we can perform the same operation quickly and easily using vectorized operations:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> df.loc[df[\"B\"] == 8, \"B\"] = 99\n","\n",">>> print(df)\n","\n","       A   B  C\n","    x  6   1  0\n","    y  1  99  8\n","    z  3  99  7\n","```\n","\n","One scenario where it is useful to use loops with pandas is when we are performing aggregation. Aggregation is where we apply a statistical operation to groups of our data. Let's say that we wanted to work out what the average revenue was for each country in the data set. Our process might look like this:\n","\n","- Identify each unique country in the data set.\n","- For each country:\n","  - Select only the rows corresponding to that country.\n","  - Calculate the average revenue for those rows.\n","\n","In this process, we can use a loop to iterate over the countries. We'll still use vectorized operations to select the right rows and calculate the means, so our calculation remains fast. To identify the unique countries, we can use the [Series.unique() method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.unique.html). This method returns an array of unique values from any series. Once we have that, we can loop over that array and perform our operation. We'll use a dictionary to store the results.
